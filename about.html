      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p> Freelance designer and front-end developer who likes to spend quality time experimenting with
        CSS, HTML, Javascript, Python in order to create prototypes that represent the state of the art of the code in
        which they are written to (or at least, strives to approach).</p>
        <p>I have worked in the web industries for well over a decade and in that time, I have gained experience in organizations of various sizes and types from large international companies such as MSC, Sumas Business School to national companies operating in the field of IT training and in the offer of technological services. </p>
        <p>Working for companies with different target markets, I had the motive to work within teams of various sizes, also holding the position of project manager, each with their own constraints and objectives. This projects vary between design systems, creative campaing work, web app, vba solution and website responsive.</p>
        <p>As an extremely curious person, I love challenging challenges and pushing myself to the edge of
        technologies that I usually use, using the most suitable methodologies and tools to achieve this purpose.</p>
        <p>I mostly specialized in CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT and in the constellation of services around Office 365 with a specific focus on the methodologies that guarantee access to web content for people with disabilities.</p>
        <p>One of my great passions is the production of educational content, inherent to the conscious and safe use of technology, aimed at a pre-adolescent audience.</p>
        <p>You can read more about me over on my personal blog, or catch up with me on Twitter, CodePen or Github.</p>
